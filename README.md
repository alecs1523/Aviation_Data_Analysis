# Business Understanding
## Goal
### Identify the safest aircraft make and model to inform investment decision 

# Data Understanding
### Dataset Overview
#### Summary: The dataset contains records of aircraft crashes between 1948 - 2022. The data from 1948 -1982 is limited so we drop those data points to focus on the majority of the volume following 1982. Data points include the number of engines, seveirty of passenger injuries, severity of aircraft damage,and more.

### Important Data Columns:

#### Aircraft Make and Model: Information about the specific make and model of the aircraft involved in each incident.

#### Aircraft Damage: The severity of the damage to the aircraft

#### Severity of Injuries: A count for each incident on the number of uninjured, minor, serious, and fatal injuries.

# Data Preparation
### Identify unclean and missing data 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Explore the safest airplane maker and analyze different metrics such as the severity of aircraft damage and injuries

# Dive Deeper Into Boeing
#### Analyze Boeing at a deeper level after identifying it as the safest manufacturer

# Conclusion
#### 1. Boeing is the safest aircraft manufacturer 2. The 777 is the safest model based on the severity of damage during accidents 3. Overall, aircraft accidents have been on the decline for many years

## Recommendations
#### My recommendation is to exclusively use Boeing airplanes and specifically the 777, 737, and 737-200 models
